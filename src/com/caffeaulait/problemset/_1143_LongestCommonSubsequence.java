    /**
     * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
     *
     * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
     *
     *
     *
     * If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
     * Example 3:
     *
     * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
     * Output: 0
     * Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
